## Questions

- What is the evidence on the status of global fisheries?
- Is this controversial?
- What is driving the stress on fisheries since the 1980s?
- What is a trophic cascade? What is CPUE?

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/database/)

# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Download zipfile from Zenodo link at [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/database/).
Get data:
```{r}
# unzip("RAMLDB v4.495.zip")
load("R Data/DBdata[asmt][v4.495].RData")
```



### We want the CPUE time series data for Atlantic Cod. How do we extract that? 

Find all the stock IDs for Atlantic cod & retain them in a vector
```{r}
stock %>%
  filter(commonname == "Atlantic cod")

codIDS <- stock %>%
  filter(commonname == "Atlantic cod") %>%
  select(stockid)

codIDS

```


Filter the CPUE table based on these IDs
```{r}

# First retain only codIDs that exist in cpue.data
codIDS2 <- codIDS %>%
  filter(stockid %in% colnames(cpue.data))
codIDS2

cod_cpue_data <- 
  cpue.data %>%
  subset(select=unlist(codIDS2)) # unlist converts the list of IDs to a character array, which is needed by Select

```


Data clean up- there are a few things we need to do to make the data more suitable for ggplot
```{r}
# Make rownames (year) into a variable column
cod_cpue_data <- rownames_to_column(cod_cpue_data, var = "year")

# Make data "longer": ggplot really likes long data over wide data
cod_cpue_data <- pivot_longer(cod_cpue_data, !year, names_to = "species", values_to = "cpue")


cod_cpue_data
```


Plot CPUE data for the two stock that were assessed by CPUE
```{r}
ggplot(data = cod_cpue_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = cpue, color = species)) +
  xlim(1995, 2011) 
```


# In-class Activity
First, let's seek to replicate the following figure from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment on total landings using the RAM data.


![](http://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/cod.jpg)


Make plots with total landings (`TL`) data
- Read a little about the database structure in `Database Structure (12-5-19).docx`, in the Database documents folder
- Read about files and abbreviations in `Database Structure (12-5-19).docx`
- Total landings are in `timeseries_values_views` as TL but also pulled out separately in `tl.data`


Modify `tl.data` to make years into a column, pivot longer, and remove empty rows
```{r}
# Make rownames (year) into a variable column
tl.data.mod <- rownames_to_column(tl.data, var = "year")

# Make data "longer": ggplot really likes long data over wide data
tl.data.mod <- pivot_longer(tl.data.mod, !year, names_to = "stockid", values_to = "TL")

# Remove empty rows for convenience
tl.data.mod <- tl.data.mod %>% drop_na(TL)

tl.data.mod
```

Attach the scientific names to the stock IDs
(Hint- this is in `stockid`)

```{r}
tl.data.mod <- left_join(tl.data.mod,stock, by = "stockid")
tl.data.mod
```

CHALLENGE - Calculate total landings per year for all species
```{r}
tl.data.mod <- tl.data.mod %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(TL_allspecies = sum(TL))

tl.data.mod
```
# Plot landings over time!
```{r}
ggplot(data = tl.data.mod) +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = TL_allspecies))
```
